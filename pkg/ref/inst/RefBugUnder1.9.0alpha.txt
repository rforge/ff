
I was notfied that my package ref fails R CMD CHECK under 1.9.0 Alpha.
I downloaded the windows version of 1.9.0 Alpha (dated 2004-03-17) and package ref passes R CMD CHECK without any complaints. 

The daily checks suggest the problem arises in example(optimal.index)

Error in identical(l[i], l[optimal.index(i, n = length(l), strict = FALSE)]) : 
	only 0's may mix with negative subscripts

where negative subscripts are mixed with NAs (which was legal in versions prior 1.9.0).
Is it an intended change not to allow this any longer? (I did not find any hint in NEWS)

Best regards
