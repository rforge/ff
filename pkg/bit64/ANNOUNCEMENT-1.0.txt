Dear R community,

Package 'bit64' Version 0.5 is available on CRAN. 
It provides 64bit (signed) integers, coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters and it  requires by factor 7 less RAM than those from package int64. 
It has the usual vector operations and summary functions and they are up to about factor 1000 faster than those from package int64. 

Best regards
