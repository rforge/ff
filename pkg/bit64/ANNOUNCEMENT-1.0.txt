Dear R community,

Package 'bit64' Version 0.6 is available on CRAN. 

Package 'bit64' provides serializable S3 atomic 64bit (signed) integers 
that can be used in vectors, matrices, arrays and data.frames. Methods are 
available for coercion from and to logicals, integers, doubles, characters  
as well as many elementwise and summary functions. 

With 'integer64' vectors you can store very large integers at the expense
of 64 bits, which is by factor 7 better than 'int64' from package 'int64'.
Due to the smaller memory footprint, the atomic vector architecture and  
using only S3 instead of S4 classes, most operations are one to three orders
of magnitude faster: Example speedups are 4x for serialization, 250x for 
adding, 900x for coercion and 2000x for object creation. Also 'integer64' 
avoids an ongoing (potentially infinite) penalty for garbage collection
observed during existence of 'int64' objects. Cited measurements were done 
under RWin64, under RWin32 the performance advantage is smaller.

Last but not least, this package has no commercial copyright attached, 
it is not sponsored by any commercial company or otherwise influenced 
by commercial interests. Its mix of high-level R code with low-level 
C-code protects against misuse outside the GPLed R context.

Best regards
