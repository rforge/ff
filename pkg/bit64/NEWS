	  , 'sort', 'order', 'rank', 'quantile', 'median' and 'summary'
    o new generics and methods for data management: 
	    'unipos' (positions of the unique values)
	  , 'tiepos' (positions of ties)
	  , 'keypos' (positions of values in a sorted unique table) 
	  and derived methods 'as.factor' and 'as.ordered'

USER VISIBLE CHANGES

    o the package is back on CRAN. Method 'as.vector.integer64' has been removed 
	  at request of the CRAN maintainer. The starting point for this request was: 
	  'matrix(integer64())' does not work. The result of removing 
	  'as.vector.integer64' is a deterioration: 'array(integer64())' does not work 
	  anymore. You can restore 'as.vector.integer64' if you prefer.
    o package 'bit64' now shares generics for low-level sorting with package 'ff' 
	  and depends on package 'bit' for those generics
